====================================
Account invoices in company currency
====================================

This module adds functional fields to show invoices in the company currency:
amount untaxed, amount taxed and amount total.

These fields are shown in "Other information" tab in invoice form.


Usage
=====

**NOTE #1**: Amount untaxed and amount total are official account fields in v9.
This addon adds amount taxes and shows all of them in invoice form.

**NOTE #2**: Please note that these fields are negative (as done in v9 account addon)
for credit notes (for example a refund invoice)


Known issues / Roadmap
======================

These fields name change from v8:

* cc_amount_untaxed -> amount_untaxed_signed (already in account v9)
* cc_amount_tax -> amount_tax_signed (added by this addon)
* cc_amount_total -> amount_total_company_signed (already in account v9)
